        <h1>Android's mascot history</h1>

        <p>You probably know that the <strong>Android</strong> operating system maintained by <strong>Google</strong> is one of the most used for mobile devices around the world. But don't you know that your friendly pet has a very curious name and history? Well, follow this article to learn a lot about this little robot.</p>

      <h2>The first version</h2>

      <p>The first attempt to create a mascot came in 2007 and came from a developer named <a href="https://androidcommunity.com/dan-morrill-shows-us-the-android-mascot-that-almost-was-20130103/" target="_blank" class="external">Dan Morrill.</a> He says he opened <a href="https://inkscape.org/pt/" target="_blank" class="external">Inkscape</a> (free software for vectorizing images) and created his own version of the robot. The goal was just to personify the system just for your team, there was no request from the company to create a mascot.</p>

          <img class="firstlogo" src="images/dan-droids.png" alt="first android mascot"></picture>
        
   

    <p>This bizarre first version was even named after its creator: it would be the <strong>Dandroids</strong>.</p>
      
      <h2>Appears a new mascot</h2>

      <p>The idea of ​​having a mascot matured and the mission was passed on to a professional in the field. Russian illustrator <a href="https://www.irinablok.com/android" target="_blank" class="external">Irina Blok</a>, also a Google employee, was tasked with representing the little robot in a more pleasant way.</p>

      <p>Irina's main idea was to represent everything graphically with few strokes and in a flatter way. The design should also generate quick identification with the person looking at it. Then came the <strong>Bugdroid</strong>, the new mascot of Android.</p>

      
      <img src="images/bugdroid.png" class="small" alt="bugdroid">

      <p>The main inspiration came from the little dolls from WC to indicate the gender of each door.The artist was creating in her office's table, whe she saw the bathroom door, the identification was immediate: simple, clean and objective</p>
